# 👋 Hi, I'm Hyungseok Moon (문형석)
Trilingual (KR/JP/EN) technical support engineer with a background in full-stack development, enterprise system troubleshooting, and customer-facing operations across Korea and Japan.

I focus on:

🔍 Debugging & reproducing issues

🔐 Authentication flows (OAuth, SSO)

🔌 API integration & connectivity

🧩 Breaking down complex system behavior

🎨 Building clean UI/UX with React

⚙️ Writing maintainable backend code with Node.js

I love turning unclear problems into clear solutions — whether through log analysis, API debugging, or hands-on code investigation.
